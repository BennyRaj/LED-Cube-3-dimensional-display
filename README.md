# LED-Cube-3-dimensional-display
3D LED cube is a real 3D display that is built from many individual LEDs arranged in X, Y and   Z axis. Because many LEDs are used these displays have complicated structure, electronic board   and software. Electronic modules for constructing free dimension 3D LED cube including main   board that is based on microcontroller unit (MCU), layer module and column module that both   are based on shift register.
